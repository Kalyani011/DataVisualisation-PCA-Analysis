# Section 1: PCA

## Section 1 Solution
Following the worksheet [1], PCA was performed on the given data-set of handwritten digits and visualizations were created as follows:

```{r Loading Libraries, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading libraries
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(FactoMineR)
library(factoextra)
library(ggplot2)
library(colorblindr)
```

The data-set given in *pendigits.csv* file was read into a data frame as follows:
```{r Reading data set, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Reading data from csv file
DIGITS <- read_csv(file = 'pendigits.csv', col_names=FALSE)

# Renaming target column to digit
names(DIGITS)[17] <- "digit"

# Displaying first 5 rows of DIGITS
head(DIGITS)
```
  
  
+ Performing PCA on the data set with 16 features to reduce the dimensionality from 16 to 2.  
+ No feature processing was performed on DIGITS as all 16 features are numeric factors labeled from X1 to X16.  
+ The factors are not scaled either as each factor has levels on the same scale (values between 0 to 100).
```{r Performing PCA, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Using dplyr select method to select all dependent factors from data set,
# except for the target factor "digit".
# The selected factors are piped into PCA method of "FactoMineR" library
# Applying PCA to DIGITS data-set and saving the components in "pca" object
select(DIGITS, -digit) %>% PCA(graph = FALSE) -> pca
```

+ Plotting the Scree plot to analyse variance captured by each principle component.  
+ The first two principle components cover around 50% of data variance of the data as depicted by the plot below,
```{r Plotting Screeplot, fig.cap="Data Variance Distribution of Principle Components for DIGITS data set", echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = '70%', fig.align='center'}
# Plotting scree plot
fviz_screeplot(pca, choice="variance", addlabels = TRUE)
```


Plotting the loadings plot, 
```{r Loadings Plot, echo=TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Plotting loadings_plot
loadings_plot <- fviz_pca_var(pca, col.var = "contrib", 
                 gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"), 
                 repel = TRUE) +  xlab("PC1") + 
                 ylab("PC2") +
                 # removing the custom title, plot fig is captioned below
                 ggtitle("") +
                 theme(
                    legend.position = c(1.10, 0.85),
                    legend.box.margin = margin(0, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05)
                 )
```

```{r Displaying Loadings Plot, fig.cap="PCA Loadings Plot for DIGITS Dataset", echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
loadings_plot
```

+ From Figure 1, it can be concluded that factors X6, X8, X14 have the highest impact among all features.  
+ X6 and X8 have a strong positive correlation with principle component 1 (PC1), and X14 has a negative correlation with PC1, however, while X8 also has a positive correlation with PC2, X6 and X14 do not have any significant relation with PC2.  
+ Other features that may have a significant impact on the principle components are,

  1. X4 has a positive correlation with PC1 and a negative correlation with PC2.

  2. X10 and X9 have a positive correlation with PC2, but little relation with PC1.

  3. X16 has a negative correlation with both the principle components.

  4. X12 has a positive correlation with PC2, but is negatively correlated to PC1.

+ The remaining features have a combination of positive and negative correlation with PC1 and PC2, but their impact is smaller.

# Section 2: Custom Palette

## Section 2 Solution

The custom palette for the 10 qualitative classes of digits from 0 to 9 was created as follows,

1. The HSL(A) functionality of [colorizer.org](http://colorizer.org/) tool was used to create the palette.

2. The saturation and lightness were set to fixed values and the hue was changed to get 10 distinct colors.

3. Further, the hex values obtained from colorizer.org were fed into the hcl_color
_picker() tool, where the Chroma and Luminance for each hex value was adjusted to match each other and the palette was exported as hex values.

4. Due to the large size of classes, red and green colors were selected together despite the problem they present for people with color vision deficiency, however a darker red and a lighter green was created using hcl_color_picker() to make the visualization more perceptible.

5. The palette was also tested for different classes using scatter plot, and colors were assigned to classes to provide as clear distinction as possible.

```{r Custom Palette, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Saving the hex values obtained from colorizer.org and 
# adjusted with hcl_color_picker in "custom_palette"
custom_palette <- c('#9F69E1', '#59C7DB',  '#F1954D', '#E562A5','#6C7AEA',
                    '#59DCB2', '#CB464E',  '#EFD456', '#D065DF', '#4D8FD3')

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
print("The hex values for the colors in the custom palette are:")
```

```{r Print hex values, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
print(custom_palette)
```
```{r Color Bar of Custom Palette, fig.cap="Custom Palette of 10 Colors to Represent Digits 0 to 9", echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
# Plotting the color bar using palette_plot method
palette_plot(custom_palette, label_size=3)
```

# Section 3: ggplot2 Scatterplot

## Section 3 Solution

The scatterplot of data using first two principle components is as follows:

```{r Scatterplot data preparation, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Getting the projection of samples in terms of principle components
data_pca_ind <- get_pca_ind(pca)
# Selecting all rows in data-set with first two principle component values
data_pca <- data_pca_ind$coord[,c(1,2)]
# Converting data into a data frame
data_pca <- as.data.frame(data_pca)
# Naming the columns
names(data_pca)[1] <- "Principle_Component_1"
names(data_pca)[2] <- "Principle_Component_2"
# Combing the PC values with target column for each data point
data_pca<- cbind(data_pca, DIGITS$digit)
# Setting the target column name to digit
names(data_pca)[3] <- "digit"
# Setting digit to factor
data_pca$digit <- as.factor(data_pca$digit)
```

Plotting Scatterplot for *data_pca* with data points plotted using **geom_point** and colored using the custom palette created in section 2:

```{r Scatterplot, fig.cap="PCA Scatterplot for DIGITS Dataset", echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
# ggplot for creating scatterplot for data_pca
digits_scatter <- ggplot(data_pca, aes(x=Principle_Component_1, y=Principle_Component_2, 
                     color=digit)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.4) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype="dashed") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype="dashed") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = custom_palette) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_palette) +
  stat_ellipse(geom = "polygon",type = "t", size = 0.2,
               aes(fill = digit),
               alpha = 0.08) +
  theme_minimal()
digits_scatter
```

The following code was used to represent the scatter plot without colors,

```{r Scatterplot without color, fig.cap="PCA Scatterplot for DIGITS Dataset, without colored data points", echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
# ggplot for creating scatterplot for data_pca without colored data points
ggplot(data_pca, aes(x=Principle_Component_1, y=Principle_Component_2, color=digit)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, colour="black") +
  stat_ellipse(geom = "polygon",type = "t",size = 0.2,
               aes(fill = digit), 
               alpha = 0.08) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype="dashed") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype="dashed") +
  theme_minimal()
```

+ As can be seen from Figure 5, removing the color of data points creates ambiguous visualization due to the multiple overlapping data points and number of classes.  

+ Compared to Figure 5, Figure 4 visualization, with colored data points gives better insight into which classes have overlapping features.  

+ To further understand which classes have similar features and overlap, removing the data points from the Scatterplot and retaining colored ellipses provides a clearer visualization as follows,

```{r Scatterplot Only Ellipses, fig.cap="PCA Scatterplot for DIGITS Dataset without Data Points", echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
# ggplot for creating scatterplot for data_pca without data points 
# and containing only colored ellipses
ggplot(data_pca, aes(x=Principle_Component_1, y=Principle_Component_2, 
                     color=digit)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype="dashed") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype="dashed") +
  scale_colour_manual(values = custom_palette) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_palette) +
  stat_ellipse(geom = "polygon",type = "t", size = 0.2,
               aes(fill = digit),
               alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

+ In all three visualizations (Figure 4, 5 and 6) there is an overlapping between the groups of data points.  

+ This is due to the fact that the numeric features representing the digits may have close values for the digits with similar shapes and curves.  

+ For example, the digits 3 and 5 have similar shapes, which implies that they must share certain features with same values, these features are projected onto the principle components as well. The pink colored ellipse representing digit 3 is almost contained within the group for digit 5 represented as the green ellipse.

**CVD Simulation**:

**cvd_grid(digits_scatter)** plots the CVD simulation of Figure 4,

```{r cvd plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="CVD Simulation of Scatterplot for Digits Dataset", out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("CVD_Plot.png")
```

+ From the simulation displayed in Figure 7, it can be deduced that the plot might not be easily readable for someone with cvd.  
+ While the plot depicted in Figure 8 below, might provide a general overview of the classes and their relation with the principle components and each other, the large number of target classes make it difficult to represent each of the 10 classes with a distinct hue, leading to the use of related colors in the palette.  
+ It can be seen that atleast 3 to 4 classes end up having the same color in the CVD simulation even when the colors are distinct in plot without CVD simulation.  

```{r cvd plot without data points, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="CVD Simulation of Scatterplot for Digits Dataset, Without Data Points", out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("CVD_Plot_Without_Data_Points.png")
```
